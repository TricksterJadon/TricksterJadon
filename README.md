## Hey there 👋

I’m a learning focused developer based in Germany.

I am currently strengthening my foundations in Python and learning by building small personal projects.
Progress and discipline matter more to me than speed.

### Tech and interests 🧠

- Artificial intelligence with a focus on fundamentals.
